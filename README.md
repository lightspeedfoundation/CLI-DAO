### DAO Token Smart Contract (Solidity)

To create a DAO token with governance capabilities, we'll use a standard ERC-20 token with voting extensions based on OpenZeppelin's libraries. This token supports delegation for voting power. I've assumed deployment on Ethereum as the primary chain, but you can deploy similar contracts on the other 5 chains if the token needs to be natively bridged (e.g., using a bridge like Wormhole or LayerZero for cross-chain consistency). The Smart Wallet API can then manage interactions across chains via its unified wallet.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Permit.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Votes.sol";

contract DAOToken is ERC20, ERC20Permit, ERC20Votes {
    constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("DAO Token", "DAO") ERC20Permit("DAO Token") {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
    }

    // The following functions are overrides required by Solidity.
    function _update(address from, address to, uint256 value) internal override(ERC20, ERC20Votes) {
        super._update(from, to, value);
    }

    function nonces(address owner) public view virtual override(ERC20Permit, Nonces) returns (uint256) {
        return super.nonces(owner);
    }
}
```

- **Deployment Notes**: Deploy this on each of the 6 chains supported by the Smart Wallet API. Mint initial supply as needed. Users can delegate their voting power using `delegate(address delegatee)`.

### DAO Governor Contract for Voting (Solidity)

This is the governance contract where proposals are created and voted on. It uses the DAO token for voting weight. Voting is on-chain, but users will interact with it gaslessly via the Smart Wallet API (see below).

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/Governor.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorSettings.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorCountingSimple.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorVotes.sol";

contract DAOGovernor is Governor, GovernorSettings, GovernorCountingSimple, GovernorVotes {
    constructor(IVotes _token)
        Governor("DAOGovernor")
        GovernorSettings(1 /* voting delay: 1 block */, 50400 /* voting period: ~1 week in blocks */, 0 /* proposal threshold */)
        GovernorVotes(_token)
    {}

    // The following functions are overrides required by Solidity.
    function quorum(uint256 blockNumber) public pure override returns (uint256) {
        return 1000e18; // Example: 1,000 tokens needed for quorum (adjust as needed)
    }

    function _getVotes(address account, uint256 timepoint, bytes memory /*params*/) internal view virtual override(GovernorVotes, Governor) returns (uint256) {
        return super._getVotes(account, timepoint, new bytes(0));
    }
}
```

- **Usage**: 
  - Deploy after the token, passing the `DAOToken` address to the constructor.
  - Create proposals via `propose(targets, values, calldatas, description)`.
  - Vote via `castVote(proposalId, support)` where support is 0 (against), 1 (for), or 2 (abstain).
  - For cross-chain: If tokens are bridged, voting weight could be aggregated via an oracle or cross-chain messages, but that's advancedâ€”start with per-chain governors if needed.

### Integrated Voting System Using the Smart Wallet API (Python Example)

The voting system integrates with the Smart Wallet API by allowing users to create a smart wallet (holding the DAO token across the 6 chains) and execute votes gaslessly via API calls. This assumes the API handles cross-chain unification (e.g., aggregated token balance for voting weight) and sponsors gas. I've provided a Python script using `requests` for API calls and `web3.py` for encoding transactions. Replace placeholders with actual values.

The script:
- Creates a smart wallet via the API.
- Executes a vote transaction on the governor contract (e.g., on the primary chain like Ethereum).

```python
import requests
from web3 import Web3

# Placeholders for API routes and config (replace with actual Smart Wallet API details)
BASE_URL = "https://your-smart-wallet-api.com"  # Placeholder for API base URL
API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"  # Placeholder for your API key
CREATE_WALLET_ROUTE = "/create-wallet"  # Placeholder for wallet creation endpoint
EXECUTE_TX_ROUTE = "/execute-transaction"  # Placeholder for transaction execution endpoint (handles gas sponsorship)
SUPPORTED_CHAINS = ["ethereum", "polygon", "avalanche", "bnb", "optimism", "arbitrum"]  # Placeholder for the 6 chains

# Governor contract details (deployed on primary chain, e.g., Ethereum)
GOVERNOR_ADDRESS = "0xYourGovernorContractAddress"  # Placeholder for deployed governor address
CHAIN_RPC_URL = "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your_infura_key"  # Placeholder for primary chain RPC (e.g., Ethereum)
GOVERNOR_ABI = [  # Minimal ABI for castVote function
    {
        "inputs": [
            {"internalType": "uint256", "name": "proposalId", "type": "uint256"},
            {"internalType": "uint8", "name": "support", "type": "uint8"}

        print(f"Vote executed: {response.json()}")
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to execute vote: {response.text}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    wallet = create_smart_wallet()
    print(f"Created smart wallet: {wallet}")
    vote_on_proposal(wallet, proposal_id=123456789, support=1)  # Vote 'for' on proposal
```

- **How It Utilizes the API**:
  - Wallet creation: Calls the placeholder route to set up a wallet for the DAO token, unified across 6 chains (no manual gas setup needed).
  - Voting: Encodes the vote as calldata and sends it via the API's execute route. The API handles signing, gas sponsorship, and any cross-chain logic (e.g., using the token's balance from any chain).
  - Assumptions: The API supports API-key auth, gasless txs, and cross-chain token operations. If the API has additional routes (e.g., for transferring tokens or querying balances), add similar functions with placeholders like `TRANSFER_ROUTE = "/transfer-token"`.
  - Customization: If voting needs to aggregate weights cross-chain on-chain, integrate a cross-chain oracle in the Governor's `_getVotes` function. For now, this keeps it simple.

This setup gives you a fully functional DAO token with on-chain voting, integrated with the Smart Wallet API for easy, gasless user interactions. If you provide more details on the API (e.g., actual routes or docs), I can refine it!
